bedRMod and related specifications
==================================

The bedRMod format formalizes the [ENCODE bedMethyl](https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/wgbs) format to represent RNA modifications. It is compatible with the BED (Browser Extensible Data) format, and most of the specifications are directly derived from the offical 
BED specifications, available under the [SAM/BAM and related specifications](http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs).

This repository provides the official specifications for the header and data sections of the bedRMod format. It is structured as the 
official [hts-specs](https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs/) repository, and some of its content is also taken from that repository.

To request improvements, changes in specifications, or to report issues, use this repository. Consult [the list of maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md) to 
contact them directly.
